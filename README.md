These are some small projects i made using C# and .NET
1.Car Insurance 

On this project I have successfully built a mini full-stack web app using Microsoftâ€™s technologies. I have utilized C# and .NET framework to simulate a car insurance website, where it's possible to take the user's input on policy information and actually calculate a quote on business logic. There is also an admin page that will allow any staff to view all the quotes that have been issued.
